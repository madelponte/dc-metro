Forked from [metro-sign](https://github.com/metro-sign/dc-metro) to add the following features:
- Support for Matrixportal S3 baords
- Allow multiple train stations
- Allow buses (each stop you want to track needs the regional code from [this map](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::metro-bus-stops/explore?location=38.923580%2C-77.046055%2C10))
- Use a "page" system to mix and match any number of trains/buses
- Optionally show metro rail and bus incidents
- Optionally predict upcoming trains if the API doesn't return enough. Based on headways of returned trains
- Implement a "walking distance" modifier to ignore trains/buses you cannot get to in time.
- Errors/Crashes will (hopefully) display on the board
- Updated to CircuitPython 10 and corresponding libraries.

Thanks to:
- Scott Garcia (scottiegarcia) for help with Metrohero API (RIP), tidying, and implementing shut off hours for the board
- ScottKekoaShay for initial implementation of swapping between train platforms (now replaced by page system)

CircuitPython 10 does away with the "secrets.py" and now uses a "settings.toml". You'll need to create one in the board's directory. Documentation is [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/scrolling-countdown-timer/create-your-settings-toml-file). The file should look like:
```
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID = "[your wifi name here]"
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD = "[your wifi password here]"
wmata_api_key = "[your api key]"
aio_username = "[your user name]"
aio_key = "[your api key]"
timezone = "America/New_York"
```

The original guide used a Matrixportal M4. If you're following this guide today then buy the Matrixportal S3. It's cheaper and more powerful. The M4 cannot reliably handle real-time incidents from GTFS because there is too much data. Buses for sure won't work. You could make train incidents work by increasing `CIRCUITPY_PYSTACK_SIZE` in your settings.toml. But if there are a lot of train incidents it could crash your board. The S3 doesn't have these problems. So in summary:
- If using an M4:
    - Set `use_gtfs_rt_for_rail_incidents` to `False` in your config file (unless you increase `CIRCUITPY_PYSTACK_SIZE` to something like 2048. Crashes could still occur)
    - Set `use_gtfs_rt_for_bus_incidents` to `False` in your config file
    - With these being `False`, the board will use WMATAs incident API instead of the GTFS endpoint. In my experience it has less accurate data
- If using an S3:
    - Set `use_gtfs_rt_for_rail_incidents` to `True` in your config file
    - Set `use_gtfs_rt_for_bus_incidents` to `True` in your config file

The rest of the code will work on both M4 and S3 boards.

Original project documentation below (with some edits by me), I'm too lazy to add a new .gif:

# Washington DC Metro Train Sign
This project contains the source code to create your own Washington DC Metro sign. It was written using CircuitPython targeting the [Adafruit Matrix Portal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745) and is optimized for 64x32 RGB LED matrices.

![Board Showing Train Arriving](img/board.gif)

# How To
## Hardware
- An [Adafruit Matrix Portal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745) - $24.99 (Update: by an S3 instead of an M4)
- A **64x32 RGB LED matrix** compatible with the _Matrix Portal_ - $39.99 _to_ $84.99
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 3mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2279)
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 4mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2278)
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 5mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2277)
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 6mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2276)
- A **USB-C power supply** (15w phone adapters should work fine for this code, but the panels can theoretically pull 20w if every pixel is on white)
- A **USB-C cable** that can connect your computer/power supply to the board

## Tools
- A small phillips head screwdriver
- A hot glue gun _(optional)_
- Tape _(optional)_

## Part 1: Prepare the Board
1. Use a hot glue gun to cover the sharp screws on the right-hand side of the 64x32 LED matrix. This step is optional, but it will prevent wire chafing later on.

    ![64x32 Matrix with Hot Glue on Screws](img/base-board.jpg)

2. Lightly screw in the phillips head screws into the posts on the _Matrix Portal_. These only need to go down about 60% of the way.

    ![Matrix Portal with Screws](img/wiring.jpg)

3. Using the power cable provided with 64x32 matrix, slide the prong for the **red power cable** between the post and the screw on the port labeled **5v**. Tighten down this screw all the way using your screwdriver. Repeat the same for the **black power cable** and the **GND** port.

    ![Matrix Portal with Separate Cables](img/cables.jpg)
    ![Matrix Portal with Connected Cables](img/portal-setup.jpg)

4. Connect the _Matrix Portal_ to the large connector on the left-hand side of the back of the 64x32 matrix.

    ![64x32 Matrix with Connector Highlighted](img/port.jpg)

5. Plug one of the power connectors into the right-hand side of the 64x32 matrix.

    ![64x32 Matrix with Power Connected](img/connected-board.jpg)

6. You can use masking tape (or painter's tape) to prevent the cables from flopping around.

    ![64x32 Matrix with Cable Management](img/cable-management.jpg)

## Part 2: Loading the Software
1. Connect the board to your computer using a USB C cable. Double click the button on the board labeled _RESET_. The board should mount onto your computer as a storage volume, most likely named _MATRIXBOOT_.
    
    ![Matrix Connected via USB](img/usb-connected.jpg)

2. Flash your _Matrix Portal_ with the latest release of CircuitPython 10.
    - Download the [firmware from Adafruit](https://circuitpython.org/board/matrixportal_m4/).
    - Drag the downloaded _.uf2_ file into the root of the _MATRIXBOOT_ volume.
    - The board will automatically flash the version of CircuitPython and remount as _CIRCUITPY_.
    - If something goes wrong, refer to the [Adafruit Documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4/install-circuitpython).

3. Decompress the _lib.zip_ file for 10.x from this repository into the root of the _CIRCUITPY_ volume. There should be one folder named _lib_, containing the required library files. You can delete _lib.zip_ from the _CIRCUITPY_ volume, as it's no longer needed.

    - It has been reported that this step may fail ([Issue #2](https://github.com/metro-sign/dc-metro/issues/2)), most likely due to the storage on the Matrix Portal not being able to handle the decompression. If this happens, unzip the _lib.zip_ file on your computer, and copy the _lib_ folder to the Matrix Portal. Command line tools could also be used if the above doesn't work.

    ![Lib Decompressed](img/lib.png)

    Maintainers can refresh `lib.zip` from the latest official CircuitPython
    10.x MPY bundle by running:

    ```sh
    scripts/build_lib_bundle.sh
    ```

    This creates a minimal bundle containing only the libraries used by this
    project. Use `--output PATH` to keep the existing archive, or
    `--bundle-date YYYYMMDD` to reproduce a specific Adafruit bundle release.
    When upgrading to a future CircuitPython major release, use
    `--circuitpython-major N` to select its matching MPY bundle.

4. Copy all of the Python files from _src_ in this repository into the root of the _CIRCUITPY_ volume.

    ![Source Files](img/source.png)

5. Create a _settings.toml_ file following [this documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/scrolling-countdown-timer/create-your-settings-toml-file). The file should look like

    ```
    CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID = "[your wifi name here]"
    CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD = "[your wifi password here]"
    wmata_api_key = "[your api key]"
    aio_username = "[your user name]"
    aio_key = "[your api key]"
    timezone = "America/New_York"
    ```

7. The board should now light up with a loading screen, but we've still got some work to do.

    ![Loading Sign](img/loading.jpg)

## Part 3: Getting a WMATA API Key
1. Create a WMATA developer account on [WMATA's Developer Website](https://developer.wmata.com/signup/).
2. After your account is created, add the _Default Tier_ subscription to your account on [this page](https://developer.wmata.com/products/5475f1b0031f590f380924fe).
3. After doing this, you will be redirected to [your profile](https://developer.wmata.com/developer).
4. Under the _Subscriptions_ section on your profile, select the **show** button beside the _Primary Key_. This is the key that allows the board to communicate with WMATA.

## Part 4: (Optional) Obtain adafruit IO Key for Off Hours.
If you'd like to configure your board to turn the display off for certain hours of the day, you'll need to set up a free account with Adafruit to make requests for the local time. You may skip this if you are not interested in this feature.

1. Follow steps 1-3 outlined [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-magtag/getting-the-date-time).
2. Make note of your username and your Adafruit IO key. Add it to the _settings.toml_ file

## Part 5: Configuring the Board
1. Open the [config.py](src/config.py) file located in the root of the _CIRCUITPY_ volume.
3. Under the **Define Pages** section:
    1. Configure your pages. The board will cycle through these displaying one at a time. Each page can be a mixture of trains or buses.
    2. For Trains, select your stations and lines from the [Metro Station Codes table](#dc-metro-station-codes), and set the _station_codes_ list to the corresponding values in the table. For trains groups see [Train Group table](#train-group-explanations), below.
    3. For buses, find regional bus stop codes from [this map](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::metro-bus-stops/explore?location=38.923580%2C-77.046055%2C10)
    4. Optionally, set the _walking_times_ values to the time it takes you to get to these stations or bus stops. This will make your sign ignore trains/buses arriving in less than this much time. NOTE: if there are no trains/buses meeting this criteria then all buses will be shown just so the board doesn't look empty.
    5. If you mess this up, the board will tell you when it tries to validate the page structure.
4. (Optional) Under the **Off Hours Configuration** section:
    1. Set the _display_on_time_ and _display_off_time_ variables to the time of day you would like the sign to be turned off and on. Note that they must be of the format "HH:MM" and use a 24 hour clock.

Here is an example config:

```python

5. After you save this file, your board should refresh and connect to WMATA.

## Troubleshooting
If something goes wrong, take a peek at the [Adafruit Documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4). Additionally, you can connect to the board using a [serial connection](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/kattni-connecting-to-the-serial-console) to gain access to its logging.
